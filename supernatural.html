                The show follows brothers Sam and Dean Winchester, who travel across America in a black 1967 Chevy Impala 
                investigating and combating paranormal events and other unexplained occurrences, many of them based on American 
                urban legends and folklore as well as classic supernatural creatures such as vampires, werewolves, and ghosts.

        <h2><a name="characters">Characters</a></h2>
        <h3>Sam Winchester</h3>
        <pre>
                Samuel "Sam" William[1] Winchester (b. May 2, 1983) is a hunter as well as a Man of Letters, 
                along with his older brother Dean. He is one of the main protagonists of Supernatural. 
                Both Sam and Dean are related to the Winchester and Campbell families - a Letters family and a 
                Hunting family respectively. The pair also shares a bloodline with Cain and Abel. Because of this, 
                Sam was predestined to be the true vessel of the fallen archangel Lucifer (whilst Dean was Michael's). 
                Sam is friends with angel Castiel, Prophet Kevin Tran, the demon Meg and former lover-turned-enemy of demon Ruby. 
                He is also the occasional reluctant ally of demon Crowley and for a time was forced to be an unknowing and 
                unwilling vessel for the angel Gadreel (before expelling him).
        </pre>
        <h3>Dean Winchester</h3>
        <pre>
                Dean Winchester (b. January 24, 1979) is a human and Hunter as well as a member of the 
                Men of Letters with his younger brother Sam. He and his brother are members of the Winchester[1] 
                and Campbell families.[2] Through his father, Dean is the older half-brother of Adam Milligan.[3]
        </pre>
        <pre>
                Dean is also the destined Vessel of the Archangel Michael.[4] He and Sam are also the surrogate 
                sons of the late Bobby Singer.[5][6] Dean is best friends with the Angel Castiel, close friend to 
                the late prophet Kevin Tran, and reluctant ally of Crowley. Dean has an ex-girlfriend, Lisa Braeden,[7] 
                who he lived with for a year[8] when he thought Sam was in Hell. She has a child named Ben, who Dean 
                acted as a father for during that year. Dean's biological child was an amazon named Emma.[9] 
                He is also the former apprentice of Alastair.
        </pre>
        <h3>Castiel</h3>
        <pre>
                Castiel, often shortened to Cass,[1] is a powerful angel of the Lord who was responsible for saving Dean Winchester 
                from Hell,[2] on the archangels' command. It was his job to help prevent Lilith from breaking the 66 Seals that, once broken, 
                would release Lucifer from his cage[3] in Hell. Once Castiel learned that the angels wished to free Lucifer anyway, he defied 
                his angelic brethren and died trying to help Dean prevent Sam Winchester from breaking the last seal.
